## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** The vision for the game was pretty easy to realize, however it was overwhelming to draw everything on my on within two weeks, but I managed!
- **Core Mechanics:** The A/D movement (left to right/right to left) of a bowl to catch the correct ingredients. 

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** Timeframe made it stressful, since one day you think you are going with a good pace on one day you feel like you are runnig out og time completly. 
- **Bug Fixes:** Fortunately, there werent a lot of bugs, but some small mistakes would appear which made it seem like everything is wrong but end up being little stuff.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Prototyping Matters:** Testing with the base game core that we had after 2D browser coding help understand the way I wanted to make my game more.
- **Keep it Simple:** Focusing on my game idea and making it as much as possible as what I imagined before the CCL helped with completing the game.
